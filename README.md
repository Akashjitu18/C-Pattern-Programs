## C++ Pattern Programs

## Overview

This repository contains 25 different C++ programs that generate various  patterns. These patterns are designed to help practice and understand fundamental programming concepts such as loops and conditionals.

## Uses

- **Educational Tool:** Great for learning and practicing basic programming concepts, including nested loops, conditional statements, and pattern generation.
- **Interview Preparation:** Useful for preparing for programming interviews where pattern problems are common.
- **Coding Practice:** Helps improve coding skills and understanding of algorithmic thinking.
- **Reference:** Provides clear examples of different types of patterns that can be adapted for various applications.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Akashjitu18/C-Pattern-Programs.git

   
2. **Open a text editor and add the code** 

3. **Save the file as: filename.cpp**

4. **Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you saved the file**

5. **Type 'g++ filename.cpp' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file**

6. **Now, type 'a.out' to run your program**
